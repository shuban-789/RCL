# RCML

Really Cool Math Library (RCML) is a mathematics library which aims to provide functions for Rust and C/C++ programs that require advanced mathematical computations. Covers calculations regarding single-variable and multivariable calculus, linear algebbra, and more.

> NOTE:
> Limits and any limit dependent function will not be perfectly correct but extremely close to the correct value due to the way they are calculated. A standard convention for tolerance may be used in the future. Integration follows Simpson's Rule calculation as of now.
