# RCL

Rudimentary Calculus Library (RCL) is a simple calculus library which aims to provide basic single-variable and multivariable calculus functions for programs written in Rust and C/C++

> NOTE:
> Limits and any limit dependent function will not be perfectly correct but extremely close to the correct value due to the way they are calculated. A standard convention for tolerance may be used in the future. Integration follows Simpson's Rule calculation as of now.

> TODO:
> - Potentially make an `nderive()` function such that any nth derivative can be calculated with minimal hard coding
> - Potentially figure out a system for working with returning indefinite results for integration or differentiation
